# Todo App

This is a simple Todo application implemented in Objective-C. It allows users to manage their tasks with features such as creating new tasks, moving tasks between different states (Todo, In Progress, Done), searching for tasks, filtering tasks based on their state, and editing existing tasks.

## Features
